Multi-Model Big Data Analytics for E-Commerce


This project implements a multi-model big data analytics system for an e-commerce platform using MongoDB, Apache HBase, and Apache Spark.
•	MongoDB is used for storing business data such as users, products, and transactions
•	HBase is used for storing large-scale browsing session logs
•	Spark is used to perform batch analytics on the dataset
A synthetic e-commerce dataset was generated and analysed to produce insights such as revenue by category, top-spending customers, product affinity patterns, and the relationship between user engagement and spending.
The project demonstrates how using multiple data technologies together improves scalability and analytical flexibility compared to a single-database approach.
